      <description>The weather does feel hotter than when I was growing up. But is it because population has grown significantly, resulting in greater consumption, and creation of things that release carbon into the atmosphere? Is there a way to grow without consuming resources in parallel? What is growth anyway? Why do we need to grow? Is it ingrained into our human nature to want to buy things? What is human nature? Can politics change human nature?</description>
