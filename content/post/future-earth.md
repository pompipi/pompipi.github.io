The weather does feel hotter than when I was growing up. But is it because population has grown significantly, resulting in greater consumption, and creation of things that release carbon into the atmosphere? Is there a way to grow without consuming resources in parallel? What is growth anyway? Why do we need to grow? Is it ingrained into our human nature to want to buy things? What is human nature? Can politics change human nature?

Future Earth is a framework to explore all this issues as an interrelated web of ideas, activities. 

Sustainability today is a politically charged agenda. This probably is a result of everybody feeling we need to do something about it, but disagrees how, and with too much vested interest to ignore. But sustainability is also limited in its scope, and very much places the discourse within the political frameworks.

Future Earth explores these ideas.

The role of technology in all this?
- Green tech: carbon removal, new materials, new production means
- Measure tech: ways to measure economy, climate impact, impact of intervention activities
  - Not as developed?
- Community tech: using social to activate collective action
- Data centres need to be green
