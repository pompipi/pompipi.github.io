The weather does feel hotter than when I was growing up. But is it because population has grown significantly, resulting in greater consumption, and creation of things that release carbon into the atmosphere? Is there a way to grow without consuming resources in parallel? What is growth anyway? Why do we need to grow? Is it ingrained into our human nature to want to buy things? What is human nature? Can politics change human nature?

Future Earth is a framework to explore all this issues as an interrelated web of ideas, activities. 

Sustainability today is a politically charged agenda. This probably is a result of everybody feeling we need to do something about it, but disagrees how, and with too much vested interest to ignore. But sustainability is also limited in its scope, and very much places the discourse within the political frameworks.

Future Earth explores these ideas.

The role of technology in all this?
- Green tech: carbon removal, new materials, new production means
- Measure tech: ways to measure economy, climate impact, impact of intervention activities
  - Not as developed?

It seems to me that so many of the science oriented approach to climate studies, misses the point about the very human cause, and impact that climate change has to us. There is so much science, analysis, and reams of PDF pages to read, wrapped in technical language, that it feels inaccessible to you and I. The argument has to be though, that humans are the ones that caused this through massive population growth coupled with unbridled wants of things. It's not governments, industry, or corporations that is the cause of this. It's us. Paris Agreements, Net Zero targets, discussed at the pan-national level simply disassociates the issue from our everyday lives.

People then look for solutions at that level. The decoupled growth suggestion, looks at how GDP at the national level, can be decoupled from resource use. A creative solution seemingly allowing us to weasle our way out of the problem at hand. Have your carbon and eat it, will you. What needs to be done, is for each of us, to think about what is the goal and purpose of our existence. Is it to consume? Make more money? Some greater calling?

If it is to consumer or make more money and be rich, then we are likely all doomed. As there is no scenarios where we have infinite consumption on a finit earth. What more, solutions are invented within the market system, which by definition is about consumption. So for example, when someone says, there's not enough finance moving into sustainability activities, it's thinking within the means of the market. There is an implied assumption, not only that the market is the way to solve this, but that money will solve this. The more money, the more effort we will put into this. But unfortunately, we as consumers don't really get to benefit the way buying from Amazon benefits us does it. So then how will this money beget profit, especially when so much of the benefit is non-economic, but social in nature.

It has to be something more than consumption, or GDP, to have any chance to avoid the inevitable conclusion.

Take a look at Patagonia Inc. They have an advanced set of products, services, and policies that connect them back to the nuts and bolts of what's wrong with consumption. They make things that last, encourage not to buy but repair or buy used, and they actively participate in environmet activism, giving 1% of sales back to causes (And is that 1% from owned-stores, or from their entire distribution?), and setup a platform for other companies and people, to be part of that. Connecting profit making into influencing responsible consumption is key. But what impact have they made? What if all companies did this? What if smartphone makers made phones that will last half a lifetime?

But on the flip side, althought Patagonia Inc. celebrates all these, when they talk about workers paid a living wage, you'd wonder why they are so much poorer than us. Why are they the ones making our products, it that really the status quo? Can corporations do more to right income inequality?

So how far can companies play a role in climate change? They are at the end, part of the capitalist free-market system that has led us to this.

If we can put in place a regulation that requires bidding for the right to own a car, thereby curtailing our market freedom, why would we not put in place a policy that curtails consumption, and rewards social good? Past a certain threshold, greater GDP growth does not equate to personal happiness.

The free-market system - profit making, self-interest

But we are surely better. At the end, the road to disaster is still often borne out of good intentions.
